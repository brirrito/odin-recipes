    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This absurdly easy recipe comes from Colin Alevras, the then chef at the Tasting Room in New York, until it closed in 2008.</p>
    <p>Browning the butter elevates these plebeian snacks into something more toothsome, and it adds just an extra couple of minutes to the process. They're so good.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>8 ounces butter, salted or unsalted, preferably cultured, plus extra for pan</li>
        <li>2 10.5-ounce bag marshmallows</li>
        <li>1 12-ounce box Rice Krispies treats</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Line rimmed sheet pan with parchment paper or wax paper, or butter it well.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, melt butter over medium-low heat. It will melt, then foam, then turn clear golden and finally start to turn brown and smell nutty. Watch closely and stir often.</li>
        <li>When butter is evenly browned, stir in marshmallows. Melt and cook, stirring often, until mixture turns pale brown, then stir constantly until lightly browned but not dark, 3-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn off heat, add cereal, and mix well, preferably with a silicone spoon or a spatula. Scrape into prepared pan and press down lightly. If necessary, butter hands to press mixture flat. Let cool, and cut into squares or bars.</li>
      </ol>
