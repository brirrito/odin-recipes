    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a cake to stop traffic. The layers are an improbable red that can vary from flourescent pink to a dark ruddy mahogany.</p>
    <p>The color, often enhanced by buckets of food coloring, becomes even more eye-catching against clouds of snowy icing.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3.5 cups cake flour</li>
        <li>.5 cup unsweeted cocoa (not Dutch process)
        <li>1.5 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>2 cups canola oil</li>
        <li>2.25 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons (3 ounces) red food coloring</li>
        <li>1.5 teaspoons vanilla</li>
        <li>1.25 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>2.5 teaspoons white vinegar</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
       <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place teaspoon of butter in each of 3 round 9-inch layer cake pans and place pans in oven for a few minutes until butter melts. Remove pans from oven, brush interior and sides of each with butter and line bottoms with parchment.</li>
       <li>Whisk cake flour, cocoa, and salt in a bowl.</li>
       <li>Place oil and sugar in bowl of an electric mixer and beat at medium speed until well blended. Beat in eggs one at a time. With machine on low, very slowly add red food coloring. (Take care; it may splash). Add vanilla. Add flour mixture alternately with buttermilk in two batches. Scrape down bowl and beat just long enough to combine.</li>
       <li>Place baking soda in a small dish, stir in vinegar and add to batter with machine running. Beat for 10 seconds.</li>
       <li>Divide batter among pans, place in oven and bake until a cake tester comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool in pans 20 minutes. Then remove from pans, flip layers over and peel off parchment. Cool completely before frosting.</li>
      </ol>
